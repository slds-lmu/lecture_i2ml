## Slides PDFs

This directory contains all PDFs that are generated locally. 

Changes in these directories will be reflected on the corresponding course websites,
which also means that **changes to file names** will need to be adjusted in
the website repository.

The expected structure for this folder using `lecture_i2ml` as an example:

```
slides-pdf
├── slides-basics-data.pdf
├── slides-basics-learner.pdf
├── slides-basics-learnercomponents-hro.pdf
├── slides-basics-models-parameters.pdf
...
```

Here, `slides-pdf/<slide-name>.pdf` matches the source at `slides/<topic>/<slide-name>.pdf`.
