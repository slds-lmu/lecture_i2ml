# SLDS Lecture Repos Contributing Guide

This repository contains the slides and exercises for an SLDS lecture.

All relevant information for contributions is collected in the [Teaching DevOps Wiki](https://github.com/slds-lmu/lecture_service/wiki).

Any questions you may have that are not answered by this wiki can be asked in the relevant [SLDS Mattermost channel](https://lmmisld-lmu-stats-slds.srv.mwn.de/slds/channels/teaching-devops). Please ask your question there such that missing information can be added to the wiki.
