- Are you an ML expert and like the course, but have some feedback or consider
  extending it?
  Write an email to Bernd and Fabian (see [Team page](vignettes/team.Rmd)) or
  Open an [issue](https://github.com/compstat-lmu/lecture_i2ml/issues).
- Are you a student taking the lecture - either at the LMU or online - and you
  spotted a typo, think we should rephrase something be or even would like to
  provide a new quiz question or coding example? Please consider providing a
  pull request. To do so, please check out the *devel* branch of the repo and
  add your fixes there. Writing an e-mail or opening an
  [issue](https://github.com/compstat-lmu/lecture_i2ml/issues) with suggested
  improvements is obviously very welcome as well!
- You are none of the above but would like to contribute, get in touch / open
