              Automated changes by `fix-figure-paths.yaml` workflow.
              Compare and merge to keep figure paths compatible with compilation outside of overleaf.

              ## Explanation:

              From what I understand, overleaf automatically tab-completes image paths relative to the project root, e.g.
              `slides/supervised-regression/figure/nutshell-regression-poly-plot-1.pdf` - which is apparently fine on overleaf
              but causes errors when trying to compile slides locally, where paths relative to the folder containing the
              `.tex` file are required (i.e. `figure/nutshell-regression-poly-plot-1.pdf`).

              As far as I understand it the latter path should also work on overleaf.
              To locally auto-fix this, the following command can be used on Linux:

              ```sh
              sed -i -E "s\slides/[0-9a-z-]+/figure\figure\g" $(find slides -iname "*.tex")
              ```

              Which is exactly what this workflow does.
              Note that macOS requires `gnu-sed` as the default BSD `sed` behaves differently.
