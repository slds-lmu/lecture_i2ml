  \item Understand that a learner receives training data and outputs the best model from $\Hspace$

\begin{vbframe}{Supervised Learning Example}

Imagine we want to investigate how working conditions affect productivity of employees.

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is a \textbf{regression} task since the target \emph{productivity} is continuous.
	% \item It is \textbf{learn to explain} if we want to tweak the features in the future to increase productivity and \textbf{learn to predict} if we need a forecast.
	\item We collect data about worked minutes 
per week (\emph{productivity}), how many people work in the same office as the 
employee in question, and the employee's salary.
\end{itemize}

How could we construct a model from these data?\\[1ex]

We could investigate the data manually and come up with a simple, hand-crafted rule such as:


\lz
    
\begin{itemize}
\item The baseline productivity of an employee with salary 3000 and 7 people in the office is 1850 minutes
\item A decrease of 1 person in the office increases productivity by 30 
\item An increase of the salary by 100 increases productivity by 10
\end{itemize}

\lz

=> Obviously, this is neither feasible nor leads to a good model
\end{vbframe}


	
\begin{vbframe}{Idea of Supervised Learning}


\textbf{Goal:} Identify the functional relation that maps features to target.

\lz

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Supervised} learning means we use \emph{labeled} data to learn model $f$. % for which we observed the outcome.
  
  % \item For new data we can only observe the features but not the target.

%  \item We use the labeled data to learn a model f.

  \item Later, we use model $f$ to predict $y$ for 
  new \emph{unlabeled} data. % whose target values are unknown.
  
\end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{Learner Definition}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Algorithm for finding  $f$ is called \textbf{learner} / \textbf{learning algorithm} /  \textbf{inducer}.
  
  \item %We prescribe a certain hypothesis space,
  The learner is our means of picking the best element from the hypothesis space $\Hspace$
  for given training data.

\item Formally, it maps training data $\D \in \allDatasets$ (plus a vector of \textbf{hyperparameter} control settings $\lamv \in \Lam$) to a model:
\[\ind: \preimageInducerShort \rightarrow \Hspace\]
% We can also adapt this concept to finding $\thetavh$ for parametric
% models:
% \[\ind: \D \times \Lambda \rightarrow \Theta\]

  \end{center}

\item Practically, we often construct a mapping 
\[\ind: \preimageInducerShort \rightarrow \Theta\]

\end{itemize}


\framebreak
  
In pseudo-code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Learner gets a hypothesis space of parametrized functions $\Hspace$.
  \item User passes data set $\Dtrain$ and control settings $\lamv$.
  \item Learner sets parameters such that model 
    fits data best.
  \item Optimal parameters $\thetavh$ or function $\fh$ is returned for later usage.

\end{itemize}
