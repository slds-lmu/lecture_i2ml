\begin{vbframe}{Supervised Learning Example}

Imagine we want to investigate how working conditions affect productivity of employees.

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is a \textbf{regression} task since the target \emph{productivity} is continuous.
	% \item It is \textbf{learn to explain} if we want to tweak the features in the future to increase productivity and \textbf{learn to predict} if we need a forecast.
	\item We collect data about worked minutes 
per week (\emph{productivity}), how many people work in the same office as the 
employee in question, and the employee's salary.
\end{itemize}

How could we construct a model from these data?\\[1ex]

We could investigate the data manually and come up with a simple, hand-crafted rule such as:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The baseline productivity of an employee with salary 3000 and 7 people in the office is 1850 minutes
		\item A decrease of 1 person in the office increases productivity by 30 
		\item An increase of the salary by 100 increases productivity by 10
	\end{itemize}

=> Obviously, this is neither feasible nor leads to a good model

\begin{vbframe}{Idea of Supervised Learning}


\textbf{Goal:} Automatically identify the fundamental functional relation in the data 
  that maps an object's features to the target.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Supervised} learning means we make use of \emph{labeled}
  data for which we observed the outcome.
  
  % \item For new data we can only observe the features but not the target.

  \item We use the labeled data to learn a model f.

  \item Ultimately, we use our model to compute predictions for 
  \textbf{new} data whose target values are unknown.
  
\end{itemize}

% \begin{vbframe}{Idea of Supervised Learning}

% \begin{itemize}

  
  % \item However, in practical applications we don't and must try to 
  % \textbf{learn} it from give examples.
  
%  $\rightarrow$ We call such an assumed mapping a \textbf{model} $f$.
  
  % \item In machine learning, we rely on computers, which is why the model 
  % itself, as well as all feature and target values, need to be 
  % \textbf{computable}.
  
% \end{itemize}  

%\framebreak

%\begin{itemize}

%  % \item The set-up in supervised learning will typically look like this:
%  % 
%  % \begin{itemize}
%  % 
%  %   \item We restrict our options to a certain class of functions,
%  %   
%  %   \item choose some metric to evaluate model candidates,
%  %   
%  %   \item and try to find the best candidate in an efficient way.
%  %   
%  % \end{itemize} 
%  % 
%  % \item This procedure is carried out by an algorithm called \textbf{learner} or
%  % \textbf{inducer}.
  
  
  % We can see that for objects with certain 
  % patterns or properties, some values of the target are more likely than others.
  
  
  % \item Using the learned model, we can make \textbf{predictions} of the target, based on
  % the features of our data.
  
  % \item Knowing the \enquote{truth} allows us to test how well we have grasped 
  % the nature of the underlying mapping: we just need to compare our predictions 
  % to the actually observed values.

\begin{vbframe}{Learner Definition}

\begin{itemize}

  \item The algorithm for finding our $f$ is called \textbf{learner}.
      It is also called \textbf{learning algorithm} or \textbf{inducer}.
  
  \item We prescribe a certain hypothesis space,
  the learner is our means of picking the best element from that space
  for our data set.

\item Formally, it maps training data $\D \in \allDatasets$ (plus a vector of \textbf{hyperparameter} control settings $\bm{\lambda} \in \bm{\Lambda}$) to a model:
\[\ind: \preimageInducerShort \rightarrow \Hspace\]
% We can also adapt this concept to finding $\thetavh$ for parametric
% models:
% \[\ind: \D \times \Lambda \rightarrow \Theta\]

\end{itemize}

\framebreak
  
As pseudo-code template it would work like this:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Learner has a defined model space of parametrized functions $\Hspace$.
  \item User passes data set $\Dtrain$ and control settings $\bm{\lambda}$.
  \item Learner sets parameters so that model 
    matches data best.
  \item Optimal parameters $\thetavh$ or function $\fh$ is returned for later usage.

% \begin{vbframe}{Summary}
% 
% \medskip
% 
% \textbf{Supervised machine learning} is concerned with learning a function 
% that predicts a certain \textbf{target} from an object's \textbf{features} 
% from a set of examples for which both the features and the target are known.\\
% The function to be learned is restricted to come from a certain class of 
% functions and its precise shape is defined in terms of a set of 
% \textbf{parameters}.
