\begin{framei}{Tasks: Regression vs Classification}
\item Supervised tasks are data situations where learning the functional relationship between inputs (features) and output (target) is useful
\item The two most basic tasks are regression and classification, depending on whether the target is numerical or categorical

\textbf{Regression}: $\Yspace \subseteq \mathbb{R}$

\textbf{Classification}: $\Yspace = \{C_1,...,C_g\}$

\begin{frame2}{Predict vs. Explain}
We can distinguish two main reasons to learn this relationship:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Learning to predict}. Here, usually, we don't care how our model is structured or whether we can understand it.\\
We want an accurate predictor for new data.
\item \textbf{Learning to explain}. Here, our model is only a means to a better understanding of the inherent relationship in the data.\\
We might not use the learned model on new observations, but rather discuss its implications, in a scientific or social context.
Of course, a model must ``match'' the data, we usually still measure this via predictive accuracy. 
\end{itemize}  
\vfill
While ML was traditionally more interested in the former, classical statistics addressed the latter.
In many tasks nowadays both are relevant -- to different degrees.

\begin{frame2}{Regression example: House Prices}
Predict the price for a house in a certain area

Rather \textit{learn to explain}. We might want to understand what influences a house price most.
But maybe we are also looking for underpriced houses and the predictor is of direct use, too.

\begin{frame2}{Regression example: Length-of-stay}
Predict days a patient has to stay in hospital at time of admission

Can be \textit{learn to explain} but \textit{learn to predict} would help practically 
\end{frame2}


\begin{frame2}{Classification example: Risk category}
Predict one of five risk categories for a life insurance customer to determine the insurance premium

Probably \textit{learn to predict}, but the company might be required to explain
its predictions to its customers.
