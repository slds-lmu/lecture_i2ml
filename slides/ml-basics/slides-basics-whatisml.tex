  \splitV[0.7]{
  \begin{small}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item General term for very large and rapidly developing field.
      \item No strict definition, but often used when machines perform tasks that could only be solved by humans or are very difficult and assumed to require ``intelligence''.
      \item Started in the 1940s -- when the computer was invented. 
      Turing and von Neumann immediately asked:
      If we can formalize computation, can we use that to formalize ``thinking''?
      \item Includes ML, NLP, computer vision, robotics, planning, search, intelligent agents, ...
      \item Sometimes misused as a ``hype'' term for ML or ... basic data analysis.
      \item Or people refer to the fascinating developments in the area of foundation models

      \item Subfield of ML which studies neural networks.
      \item Artificial neural networks are roughly inspired by the human brain, but we treat them as useful, mathematical models.
      \item Studied for decades (start in the 1940/50s).Uses more layers, might use 
      specific neurons, e.g., for images, many computational 
      improvements to train on large data.
      % \item The term refers to the fact that rather complex neural networks, i.e. \emph{deep} networks are used
      \item Can be used on tabular data, but typical applications are images, texts or signals. 
      \item Last 15-20 years have produced remarkable results and imitations of human ability, where the result looked intelligent.

    \begin{itemizeM}
      \item Historically developed as different fields, but many
      methods and concepts are pretty much the same.
      \item ML: Rather accurate predictions with more complex models.
      \item Stats: More interpreting relationships and sound inference.
      \item Now: Both basically work on same problems with same tools.
      \item Communities are still divided.
      \item Often different terminology for the same concepts.
      % from both worlds can be used for similar tasks because ML models have gained in interpretability and statistics models have gained in predictive power
      \item Most parts of ML we could also call:\\Nonparametric statistics plus efficient numerical optimization.
      \item Personal opinion: Nowadays few practical differences, seeing differences instead of commonalities mainly holds you back

  General-purpose framework.
  At each time step an \emph{agent} interacts with an \emph{environment}. 
  It: observes state; receives reward; executes action.

    \item Goal: Select actions to maximize future reward.
    % \item Inputs are observations and feedback (rewards or punishments) from
    % interacting with an environment
    \item Reward signals may be sparse, noisy and delayed.

  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Supervised learning} for regression 
    and classification: predict labels $y$ through features $\xv$, based on training data.
    
    \item First, we will go through fundamental concepts in supervised ML: 
    \begin{itemize}
      
      \item What kind of ``data'' do we learn from?
      \item What is a ``prediction model''?
      \item How can we quantify ``predictive performance''?
      \item What is a ``learning algorithm'' 
      \item How can we operationalize learning?
      
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item We will also introduce first concrete learning algorithms: 
    Linear models, trees and forests. 
    
    \item More complex stuff comes later.
    
  \end{itemize}
