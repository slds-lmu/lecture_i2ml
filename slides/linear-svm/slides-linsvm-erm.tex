\begin{vbframe}{Regularized empirical risk minimization}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We motivated SVMs from a geometrical point of view: The margin is a distance to be maximized.
    \item This is not really true anymore under margin violations:
    The slack variables are not really distances. 
    Instead, $\gamma \cdot \sli$ is the distance by
    which an observation violates the margin.
    \item This already indicates that transferring the
    geometric intuition from hard-margin SVMs to
    the soft-margin case has its limits.
    \item There is an alternative approach to understanding
    soft-margin SVMs: They are \textbf{regularized
    empirical risk minimizers}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Soft-Margin SVM With ERM and Hinge Loss}

We derived this QP for the soft-margin SVM: 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    & \min\limits_{\thetab, \thetab_0,\sli} & \frac{1}{2} \|\thetab\|^2 + C   \sum_{i=1}^n \sli \\
    & \text{s.t.} & \,\, \yi  \left( \scp{\thetab}{\xi} + \thetab_0 \right) \geq 1 - \sli \quad \forall\, i \in \nset,\\
    & \text{and} & \,\, \sli \geq 0 \quad \forall\, i \in \nset.
  \end{eqnarray*}

  In the optimum, the inequalities will hold with equality (as we minimize the slacks), so $\sli = 1 - \yi \fxi$, but the lowest value $\sli$ can take is 0 (we do no get a bonus for points beyond the margin on the correct side).
  So we can rewrite the above: 
\begin{align*} 
    \frac{1}{2} \|\thetab\|^2 + C \sumin \Lxyi ;\; \Lyf = 
    \begin{cases} 
      1 - y f & \text{ if } y f \leq 1 \\ 
      0       & \text{ if } y f > 1 
    \end{cases}
\end{align*} 
We can also write $\Lyf = \max(1-yf, 0)$.

  $$ \risket = \frac{1}{2} \|\thetab\|^2 + C \sumin \Lxyi ;\; \Lyf = \max(1-yf, 0)$$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This now obviously L2-regularized empirical risk minimization.
    \item Actually, a lot of ERM theory was established when Vapnik (co-)invented the SVM in the beginning of the 90s.
    \item L is called hinge loss -- as it looks like a door hinge.
    \item It is a continuous, convex, upper bound on the zero-one loss.
      In a certain sense it is the best upper convex relaxation of the 0-1.
  \end{itemize}

  $$ \frac{1}{2} \|\thetab\|^2 + C \sumin \Lxyi ;\; \Lyf = \max(1-yf, 0)$$
\begin{itemize}
 \item  The ERM interpretation does not require any of the terms -- the loss or the regularizer -- to be geometrically meaningful.
  \item The above form is a very compact form to define the convex optimization problem of the SVM. 
  \item It is "well-behaved" due to convexity, every minimum is global.
  \item The above is convex, without constraints! We might see this as "easier to optimize" than the QP from before. But note it is non-differentiable due to the hinge. 
    So specialized techniques (e.g. sub-gradient) would have to be used. 
  \item Some literature claims this primal cannot be easily kernelized - which is not really true.
  \end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Other losses}

  SVMs can easily be generalized by changing the loss function.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Squared hinge loss / Least Squares SVM: $\Lyf = \max(0, (1 - yf)^2)$ 
    \item Huber loss (smoothed hinge loss)
    \item Bernoulli/Log loss. This is L2-regularized logistic regression!
    \item NB: These other losses usually do not generate sparse solutions in terms of 
      data weights and hence have no "support vectors".
  \end{itemize}
