\begin{vbframe}{Motivating Example} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Given a data set, we want to train a classification tree. 
\item We feel that a maximum tree depth of $4$ has worked out well for us previously, so we decide to set this hyperparameter to $4$. 
\item The learner ("inducer") $\inducer$ takes the input data, internally performs \textbf{empirical risk minimization}, and returns a fitted tree model $\fxh = f(\xv, \thetah)$ of at most depth $\lambda = 4$ that minimizes empirical risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We are \textbf{actually} interested in the \textbf{generalization performance} $\GEf$ of the estimated model on new, previously unseen data. 
\item We estimate the generalization performance by evaluating the model $\fh = \inducer(\Dtrain, \lamv)$ on a test set $\Dtest$: $$
\GEh_{\Dtrain, \Dtest}(\inducer,
  \lamv, \ntrain, \rho) =
  \rho \left( \yv_{\Dtest}, \F_{\Dtest, 
  \fh} \right)
$$

\begin{itemize}
\item But many ML algorithms are sensitive w.r.t. a good setting of their hyperparameters,
  and generalization performance might be bad if we have chosen a suboptimal configuration:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data may be too complex to be modeled by a tree of depth $4$ 
\item The data may be much simpler than we thought, and a tree of depth $4$ overfits
\end{itemize}
\item[$\implies$] Algorithmically try out different values for the tree depth. For each maximum depth $\lambda$, we have to train the model \textbf{to completion} and evaluate its performance on the test set. 
\item We choose the tree depth $\lambda$ that is \textbf{optimal} w.r.t. the generalization error of the model. 
\end{itemize}

% $\to$ Finding the hyperparameter $\lambda$ that is optimal w.r.t. the generalization performance constitutes an optimization problem.

% \begin{vbframe}{The role of hyperparameters}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Hyperparameters often control the complexity of a model, i.e., how flexible the model is.
% \item But they can in principle influence any structural property of a model or computational part of the training process.
% \item If a model is not flexible enough, it cannot approximate the relationship between the features and the output well and will underfit.
% \item If a model is too flexible so that it simply \enquote{memorizes} the training data, we will face the dreaded problem of overfitting.
% \item[$\implies$] Hence, controlling the model's capacity, i.e., finding suitable hyperparameters,
% can prevent overfitting the model on the training set.
% \end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{Model Parameters vs. Hyperparameters}

It is critical to understand the difference between model parameters and hyperparameters. 

\lz

\textbf{Model parameters} are optimized during training, typically via loss minimization. They are an \textbf{output} of the training. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item The splits and terminal node constants of a tree learner 
\item Coefficients $\thetab$ of a linear model $\fx = \thx$
\end{itemize}

\framebreak
  
In contrast, \textbf{hyperparameters} (HPs) are not decided during training. They must be specified before the training, they are an \textbf{input} of the training. 
Hyperparameters often control the complexity of a model, i.e., how flexible the model is.
But they can in principle influence any structural property of a model or computational part of the training process.

\lz

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item The maximum depth of a tree 
\item $k$ and which distance measure to use for $k$-NN
\item The number and maximal order of interactions to be included in a linear regression model
\item Number of optimization steps when the empirical risk minimization
is done via gradient descent
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{Types of hyperparameters}

We summarize all hyperparameters we want to tune over in a vector $\lamv \in \Lam$ of (possibly) mixed type. HPs can have different types: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Real-valued parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal error improvement in a tree to accept a split
\item Bandwidths of the kernel density estimates for Naive Bayes 
\end{itemize}
\item Integer parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neighborhood size $k$ for $k$-NN
\item $mtry$ in a random forest
\end{itemize}
\item Categorical parameters, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which split criterion for classification trees?
\item Which distance measure for $k$-NN?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Hyperparameters are often \textbf{hierarchically dependent} on each other, e.g., \emph{if} we use 
a kernel-density estimate for Naive Bayes, what is its width? 
  % with polynomials of the features up to a certain maximal degree $d$, then 
% we must specify whether to also include polynomial interaction terms like e.g. $x_j^{d-d'}x_m^{d'}$ or not 
% and up to which degree $d' \leq d$.
