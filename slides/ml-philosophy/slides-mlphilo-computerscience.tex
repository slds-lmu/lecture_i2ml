\begin{vbframe}{Computable Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item This seems like a very general and powerful concept. 
  Computable function are also called \emph{algorithms}.
\item For many kinds of problems, the mapping $f$ can be constructed explicitly, either as an actual mathematical mapping or in terms of a finite number of well-defined computable steps, i.e.,  as an algorithm that computes $f$, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(\textrm{list of elements}) = \textrm{count of distinct elements}$
\item $f(\textrm{polynomial function}) = \textrm{locations of extrem points}$
\item $f(\textrm{map of roads}) = \textrm{shortest route from A to B}$
\end{itemize}
\item Computer scientists study which kinds of functions are computable, how algorithms to compute a given $f$ scale in terms of input sizes, and how to properly construct and implement them.
\item Obviously, such manual or explicit construction of $f$ varies from entirely simple and obvious to nearly or fully impossible.
\end{itemize}
