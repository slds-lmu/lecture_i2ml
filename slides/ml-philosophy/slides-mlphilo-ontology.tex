In this course, we will deal with \textbf{supervised learning} for regression and classification only: predicting labels $y$ based on features $x$, using pattterns that we learned from labeled training data.

  \textbf{Unsupervised learning}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Data without labels $y$
      \item Search for patterns within the inputs $x$
      \item \textit{unsupervised} as there is no external criterion to optimize or \enquote{true} output
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoders ...) : Compress information in $\mathcal X$
        \item Clustering: Grouping similar observations, separating dissimilar observations
        \item Outlier detection, Anomaly detection
        \item Association rules
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\framebreak
\lz
  \textbf{Semi-Supervised learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Large amount of labeled data necessary to train reliable model
    \item Creating labeled datasets often very expensive
    \item Learn from labeled (expensive) \textbf{and} unlabeled (cheap) data
    \item Unlabeled data in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data improves learning accuracy
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.5cm}
  \textbf{Reinforcement learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Select actions in subsequent  states within a certain environment to maximize lagged future reward
    \item Example: train neural net to play mario kart (environment)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Accelerate/ steer/ break (actions) at each time point (states) during playing
      \item Reward: ranking after finish, should be maximized
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
