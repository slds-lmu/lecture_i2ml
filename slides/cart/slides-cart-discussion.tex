  \item Understand the advantages and disadvantages of CART
  \item Know when and where CART are applied
}

\begin{framei}{Advantages}
    \item Fairly easy to understand, interpret and visualize.
    \item Not much preprocessing required:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Automatic handling of non-numerical features
      \item Automatic handling of missing values via surrogate splits
      \item No problems with outliers in features
      \item Monotone transformations do not affect the model fit: scaling becomes irrelevant
    \end{itemize}
    \item Interaction effects between features are easily possible
    \item Can model discontinuities and non-linearities
    \item Performs automatic feature selection
    \item Relatively fast, scales well with larger data
    \item Flexibility through the definition of custom split criteria or leaf-node prediction rules: clustering trees, semi-supervised trees, density estimation, etc.
\end{framei}

\begin{framev}{Disadvantage: Linear Dependencies}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figure/cart_dis_1} 

}


Linear dependencies must be modeled over several splits. 
Logistic regression would model this easily with fewer parameters.
\end{framev}

\begin{framev}{Disadvantages: Smooth functions and extrapolation}


{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figure/not-smooth-extrapolation.pdf} 

}

Prediction functions of trees are never smooth as they are always step functions and do not extrapolate well beyond the training observations. % as the model a piecewise-constant function.

%In this case, the tree does not recover the smoothness of $y$ and does not extrapolate well beyond the training domain ($[0, 10]$).
\end{framev}

 \begin{framev}{Disadvantage: Instability}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item High instability (variance) of the trees
 \item Small changes in the data may lead to very different splits/trees
 \item This leads to a) less trust in interpretability b) is a reason why the prediction error of trees is usually comparably high
 \end{itemize}

Consider the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set with 699 observations on 9 features and binary target (\enquote{benign} vs. \enquote{malignant}). We fit two trees: (A) with the full data set and (B) where we eliminated a single observation. Results in label flip for 17 observations of the training data:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
  \hline
 & benign & malignant \\ 
  \hline
benign & 445 &   6 \\ 
  malignant &  11 & 236 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Rows: Predictions of (A), columns: Predictions of (B) % the learner with the complete data set, and the columns the reduced one.

% \begin{table}
% \begin{tabular}{ll}

The resulting decision trees look very different:

\begin{framei}{CART in practice}

\item Compared to other learners CART has suboptimal predictive performance, mainly because of the problems previously shown.
%\item Thus, it is rarely used in predictive tasks.
\item However, most disadvantages can be overcome when trained in ensembles: bagging or random forests.
\item Furthermore, trees are attractive tools if an interpretable model is desired or legally required.

\begin{framev}{Further tree methodologies}

This lecture is mainly focused on Classification and Regression Trees (CART) \furtherreading{BREIMAN1984} \\
However, there are noteworthy other tree-based approaches as well:

\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic Interaction Detection (AID) \furtherreading{SONQUIST1964} and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) \furtherreading{KASS1980}: Creates all possible cross-tabulations for each categorical predictor until the best outcome is achieved and no further splitting can be performed
\item C4.5 \furtherreading{QUINLAN1993}: Not limited to binary splitting
\item Unbiased Recursive Partitioning \furtherreading{HOTHORN2006}: Improves the variable selection algorithm
\end{itemize}
