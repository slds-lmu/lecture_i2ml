\begin{vbframe}{Underfitting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Occurs if model does not reflect true shape of underlying
      function
  \item Hence, predictions will be less good as they could be
  \item High train error and high test error
  \item Hard to detect, as we don't know what the Bayes error is for a task
\end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{Overfitting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Overfitting occurs when the model reflects noise or artifacts in training data,
      which do not generalize
  \item Small train error, at cost of test high error
  \item Hence, predictions of overfitting models cannot be trusted -
      but proper ML evaluation workflows should make it visible
\end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{Mathematical Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nearly no reference does that, here is one approach
\item Underfitting
    $UF(\fh, L) : = \GEfL - \GE(\fbayes, L)$\\
    Diff in GE between $\fh$ and the Bayes optimal model
\item Overfitting
    $OF(\fh, L) : = \GEfL - \riske(\fh, L)$\\
    Diff between (theoretical) GE and training error
\end{itemize}

NB: Now, RHS is both UF and OF, let's say OF has "prio". 
\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{Overfitting trade-offs}

The potential for overfitting is influenced by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Complexity of hypothesis space
  \item Amount of training data
  \item Dimensionality of feature space
  \item Irreducible noise 
\end{itemize}
\lz
Implications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The larger / more complex is $\Hspace$, 
    the more data we need to tell candidate models apart
\item The less data we have, the more we need to stick with "constrained" $\Hspace$
\item OF can happen for LMs too: If feature space is very high-dim
\item Tightly connected to the bias-var-noise decomposition of GE
of a learner ($\rightarrow$ which we study elsewhere).
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Overfitting simulation}
We simulate overfitting using regression datasets generated from $mlbench.peak$ and multiple ML hypothesis spaces with varying complexity. The resulting plots are arranged as a grid where each column is a hypothesis space and each row represents a score: $OF$, $\mathcal{R}_{emp}$ and $GE$, respectively. The metric used is $MSE$.

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figure/overfitting_simulation_plot.png}

From left to right, the plots are displayed in ascending order of the worst (highest) $GE$.

Observations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As the dimensionality of the feature space $p$ increases, $GE$ and $OF$ also increase. $\implies$ The higher the $p$, the easier to overfit.
	\item As the amount of training data $n$ increases, $GE$ and $OF$ decreases. $\implies$ The smaller the $n$, the easier to overfit.
	\item As $p$ increases, the hypothesis space needs to be complex enough to minimize $GE$ and $OF$.
	\item SVM with fixed gamma is more prone to overfitting as $p$ increases than SVM with gamma set to $\frac{1}{p}$ .
\end{itemize}
\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{Complexity vs GE}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{figure/eval_ofit_3} 
\end{center}


\vfill

\begin{itemize}
\item Common U-shape of GE if complexity or train-rounds go up.
\item Optimal level of complexity:\\
    Simplest model for which GE is not significantly outperformed
\item We could also call "Point of OF" the point where GE goes up. 
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{vbframe}{Avoiding Overfitting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use more or better data -- not always possible, but maybe can augment data, 
      e.g., for images
  \item Constrain $\Hspace$ directly by using less complex model classes
  \item Many learners come with HPs that can 
      constrain complexity
  \item Use "early-stopping"
\item Occam's razor in model selection: 
    If GE not strongly reduced for more complex class,
    use the simpler model.
\end{itemize}

\lz

All of the above are methods of regularization,
which we study in a dedicated chapter.
