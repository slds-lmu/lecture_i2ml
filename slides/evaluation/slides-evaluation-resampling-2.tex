\begin{itemize}
  \item MSE of $\GEh$ strictly better for SS
  \item Smaller var of SS enables to use larger $s$ for optimal choice
      % ()
  \item The optimal split rate now is a higher $s \approx 0.8$.
  \item Beyond $s=0.8$: MSE goes up because var doesn't go down as much as we want 
      due to increasing overlap in trainsets (see later)

\begin{frame}{Dedicated testset scenario - Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: estimate $\GEf = \E \left[\Lyfhx \right]$ via
$$\GEfh = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{\xy \in \Dtest} \Lyfhx $$
Here, only $(\xv,y)$ are random, they are $m$ i.i.d. fresh test samples


\item This is: average over i.i.d $L(y, \fxh)$,
    so directly know $\E$ and var. And can use CLT to approx distrib of $\GEfh$ with Gaussian.

\item $\E[\GEfh] = \E[\Lyfhx] = \GEf $

\item $\mathbb{V}[\GEfh] = \frac{1}{m} \mathbb{V}[\Lyfhx]$ 

\item So $\GEfh$ is unbiased estimator of $\GEf$, var decreases linearly in testset size, have an approx of full distrib (can do NHST, CIs, etc.)
\item NB: Gaussian may work less well for e.g. 0-1 loss, with $\E$ close to 0, can use binomial or other special approaches for other losses

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{vbframe}{Pessimistic Bias in Resampling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estim $\GE(\ind, n)$ (surrogate for $\GEf$ when $\fh$ is fit on full $\D$, with $|\D|=n$) via resampling based estim
        $\GEh(\ind, \ntrain)$
\begin{equation*}
\small
\begin{split}
\GEhresa = \agr\Big(
 &\rho\Big(\yv_{\Jtesti[1]}, \FJtestftraini[1]\Big), \\ &\large{\vdots} \\
& \rho\Big(\yv_{\Jtesti[B]}, \FJtestftraini[B]\Big)
    \Big),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
% \item Goal: estimate $\GEf = \E[\Lyfhx]$ via
\item Let's assume $\agr$ is avg and $\rho$ is loss-based, so $\rho_L$ 
\item The $\rho$ are simple holdout estims. So:
$$\E[\GEhresa] \approx \E[\rho\Big(\yv_{\Jtest}, \FJtestftrain\Big)] $$
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \footnotesize
\item NB1: In above, as always for $\GE(\ind)$, both $\Dtrain$ and $\Dtest$ (and so $\xv \in \Dtest$) are random vars, and we take E over them 
\item NB2: Need $\approx$ as maybe not all train/test sets in resampling of exactly same size
\end{itemize}

\framebreak

% $$  \E \left[ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{\xy \in \Dtest} L(y, \ind(\Dtrain)(\xv)) \right] = GE(\ind, \ntrain)$$

\framebreak

$$\E[\GEhresa] \approx \E[\rho\Big(\yv_{\Jtest}, \FJtestftrain\Big)] = $$
$$  \E \left[ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{\xy \in \Dtest} L(y, \ind(\Dtrain)(\xv)) \right] = \GE(\ind, \ntrain)$$


% \begin{itemize}
    % \footnotesize
% \end{itemize}

$\Rightarrow$

\begin{itemize}
    \item So when we use $\GEhresa$ to to estimate $\GE(\ind, n)$, our expected value is nearly correct, it's $\GE(\ind, \ntrain)$
    \item But fitting $\ind$ on less data ($\ntrain$ vs full $n$) usually results in model with worse perf, hence estimator is pessimistically biased 
    \item Bias the stronger, the smaller our training splits in resampling.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{No independence of CV results}
% \begin{footnotesize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Similar analysis as before holds for CV
    \item Might be tempted to report distribution or SD 
        of individual CV split perf values, e.g.
        to test if perf of 2 learners is significantly different
    % \item Since the $k$ training sets and their respective independent test sets stem
% from the same distribution we get $k$ unbiased estimators of $\GEfull$.
% \item However, in order to compare two different learners we also need to assess the 
% uncertainty of our overall  estimator.
\item But $k$ CV splits are not independent
\end{itemize}

\begin{vbframe}{No independence of CV results}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbb{V}[\GEh]$ of CV is a difficult combination of 
\begin{itemize}
\begin{footnotesize}
\item average variance as we estim on finite trainsets
\item covar from test errors,
    as models result from overlapping trainsets
\item covar due to the dependence of trainsets and test obs appear in trainsets
\end{footnotesize}
\end{itemize}
\item Naively using the empirical var of $k$ individual $\GEh$s (as on slide before) yields biased 
estimator of $\mathbb{V}[\GEh]$. Usually this underestimates the true var!
\item Worse: there is no unbiased estimator of $\mathbb{V}[\GEh]$ [Bengio, 2004]
\item Take into account when comparing learners by NHST
\item Somewhat difficult topic, we leave it with the warning here
\end{itemize}

% \begin{vbframe}{Resampling discussion}

% \begin{itemize}

%   \item In ML we fit, at the end, a model on all our given data.\\

%   \item \textbf{Problem:} We need to know how well this model will perform in 
%   the future, but no data is left to reliably quantify this.\\
%   $\Rightarrow$ Approximate using hold-out / CV / bootstrap / subsampling \\
%   estimate\\ 

%   \item \textbf{But:} pessimistic bias because we don't use all data points.\\

%   \item The final model is (usually) computed on all data points.

%   \item Strictly speaking, resampling only produces one number, the performance 
%   estimator.
%   It does NOT produce models, parameters, etc. These are intermediate results 
%   and discarded.
  
%   \item The model and parameters are only obtained when we finally fit the 
%   learner on the complete data.

% \end{itemize}

% \framebreak

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item 5-CV or 10-CV have become standard.
%   \item Do not use hold-out, CV with few iterations, or subsampling with a low 
%   subsampling rate for small samples, since this can cause the estimator to be 
%   extremely biased, with large variance.
%   \item For small-data situations with less than 500 or 200 observations, use 
%   LOO or, probably better, repeated CV.
%   \item For some models, computationally fast calculations or approximations 
%   for LOO exist.
%   \item A data set $\D$ with $|\D| = 100.000$ can have small-sample properties 
%   if one class has few observations 
%   \item Research indicates that subsampling has better properties than
%     bootstrapping. The repeated observations can cause problems in training,
%     especially in nested setups where the \enquote{training} set is split up again.
