\begin{vbframe}{Curse of dimensionality}


\begin{itemize}
\item The phenomenon of data becoming sparse in high-dimensional spaces is one effect of the \textbf{curse of dimensionality}.
\item The \textbf{curse of dimensionality} refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional spaces.
\item Our intuition about the geometry of a space is formed in two and three dimensions. 
\item We will see: This intuition is often misleading in high-dimensional spaces.
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Curse of Dimensionality: Example}
To illustrate one of the problematic phenomena of data in high dimensional data, we look at an introductory example: \\ \lz
We are given $20$ emails, $10$ of them are spam and $10$ are not. \\
Our goal is to predict if a new incoming mail is spam or not. 

\medskip

For each email, we extract the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item frequency of exclamation marks (in \%)
\item the length of the longest sequence of capital letters
\item the frequency of certain words, e.g., \enquote{free} (in \%)
\item ... 
\end{itemize}

... and we could extract many more features!

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 11cm ]{figure_man/exclamation_marks.png}
\end{center}

Based on the frequency of exclamation marks, we train a very simple classifier (a decision stump with split point $\xv = 0.25$):

\begin{itemize}
\item We divide the input space into $2$ equally sized regions.
\item In the second region $[0.25, 0.5]$, $7$ out of $10$ are spam.
\item Given that at least $0.25\%$ of all letters are exclamation marks, an email is spam with a probability of $\frac{7}{10} = 0.7$.
\end{itemize}
\framebreak


Let us feed more information into our classifier. We include a feature that contains the length of the longest sequence of capital letters.
\medskip

\vspace*{0.1cm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 10cm ]{figure_man/capital_letters.png}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the 1D case we had $20$ observations across $2$ regions.
\item The same number is now spread across $4$ regions.
\end{itemize}
\framebreak


Let us further increase the dimensionality to 3 by using the frequency of the word \enquote{your} in an email.

\framebreak

\begin{itemize}
\item When adding a third dimension, the same number of observations is spread across $8$ regions.
\item In $4$ dimensions the data points are spread across $16$ cells, in $5$ dimensions across $32$ cells and so on ...
\item As dimensionality increases, the data become \textbf{sparse}; some of the cells become empty.
\item There might be too few data in each of the blocks to understand the distribution of the data and to model it.
\end{itemize}

\section{Geometry of High-Dimensional Spaces}

\begin{vbframe}{The high-dimensional cube}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We embed a small cube with edge length $a$ inside a unit cube.
  \item How long does the edge length $a$ of this small hypercube have to be so that the hypercube covers $10\%, 20\%, ...$ of the volume of the unit cube (volume 1)?

\medskip 

  \begin{footnotesize}
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    a^p &=& \frac{1}{10} \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{1}{\sqrt[p]{10}}
  \end{eqnarray*}
  \end{footnotesize}
  \vspace*{-0.5cm}
  \item  So: covering $10\%$ of total volume in a cell requires cells with almost $50\%$ of the entire range in $3$ dimensions, $80\%$ in $10$ dimensions. 
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{The high-dimensional sphere}


Another manifestation of the \textbf{curse of dimensionality} is that the majority of data points are close to the outer edges of the sample.
 

Consider a hypersphere of radius $1$. The fraction of volume that lies in the $\epsilon$-\enquote{edge}, $\epsilon := R - r$, of this hypersphere can be calculated by the formula

\vspace*{-0.7cm}

$$
1-\left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{R}\right)^p.
$$

If we peel a high-dimensional orange, there is almost nothing left.

Consider a $20$-dimensional sphere. Nearly all of the volume lies in its outer shell of thickness $0.2$:

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Hyphersphere within hypercube}
Consider a p-dimensional hypersphere of radius $r$ and volume $S_p(r)$ inscribed in a p-dimensional hypercube with sides of length $2r$ and volume $C_p(r)$. Then it holds that 
\begin{footnotesize}
$$\lim_{p\rightarrow \infty} \frac{S_p(r)}{C_p(r)} = \lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}
\frac{\left( \frac{\pi^{\frac{p}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{p}{2}+1)} \right)r^p}{(2r)^p} =
 \lim_{p\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\pi^{\frac{p}{2}}}{2^p\Gamma(\frac{p}{2}+1)} = 0,$$
\end{footnotesize}
i.e., as the dimensionality increases, most of the volume of the hypercube can be found in its corners.

Consider a $10$-dimensional sphere inscribed in a $10$-dimensional cube. Nearly all of the volume lies in the corners of the cube:

\begin{footnotesize}
Note: For $r > 0$, the volume fraction $\frac{S_p(r)}{C_p(r)}$ is independent of 
$r$.
\end{footnotesize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Uniformly distributed data}
The consequences of the previous results for uniformly distributed data in the high-dimensional hypercube are:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Most of the data points will lie on the boundary of the space.
\item The points will be mainly scattered on the large number of corners of the hypercube, which themselves will become very long spikes.
\item Hence the higher the dimensionality, the more similar the minimum and maximum distances between points will become.
\item This degrades the effectiveness of most distance functions.
\item Neighborhoods of points will not be local anymore.
\end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Gaussians in high dimensions}

A further manifestation of the \textbf{curse of dimensionality} appears if we consider a standard Gaussian $N_p(\bm{0}, \id_p)$ in $p$ dimensions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item After transforming from Cartesian to polar coordinates and integrating out the directional variables, we obtain an expression for the density $p(r)$ as a function of the radius $r$ (i.e., the point's distance from the origin), s.t.
    $$ p(r) = \frac{S_p(r)r^{p-1}}{(2 \pi \sigma^2)^{p/2}} \exp \left( -\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),$$
    where $S_p(r)$ is the surface of the $p$-dimensional hypersphere of radius $r$.
    \item Thus $p(r) \delta r$ is the approximate probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness $\delta r$ located at radius $r$. 
    
  
\framebreak 
\item To verify this functional relationship empirically, we draw $10^4$ points from the p-dimensional standard normal distribution and plot $p(r)$ over the histogram of the points' distances to the origin:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 11cm ]{figure_man/histograms.png}
\end{center}

\item We can see that for large $p$ the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a fairly thin \enquote{shell} rather far away from the origin. \\
This may seem counterintuitive, but:

\framebreak

  \item For the probability mass of a hyperspherical shell it follows that
    $$\int^{r + \frac{\delta r}{2}}_{r - \frac{\delta r}{2}}p(\tilde{r})d\tilde{r} = \int_{r - \frac{\delta r}{2} \; \leq \; ||\xv||_2 \; \leq \; r + \frac{\delta r}{2}} f_p(\tilde{\xv}) d\tilde{\xv},$$
    where $f_p(\xv)$ is the density of the $p$-dimensional standard normal distribution and $p(r)$ the associated radial density.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 11cm ]{figure_man/2d_normal.png}
\end{center}

\item While $f_p$ becomes smaller with increasing $r$, the region of the integral -the hyperspherical shell- becomes bigger.
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{Intermediate Remarks}
However, we can find effective techniques applicable to high-dimensional spaces if we exploit these properties of real data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Often the data is restricted to a manifold of a lower dimension. \\ (Or at least the directions in the feature space over which significant changes in the target variables occur may be confined.)
\item At least locally small changes in the input variables usually will result in small changes in the target variables. 
\end{itemize}
