\begin{vbframe} {Kullback-Leibler Divergence}

We now want to establish a measure of distance between (discrete or continuous) distributions with the same support:

  $$ D_{KL}(p \| q) = \E_p \left[\log \frac{p(X)}{q(X)}\right] = \sum_{x \in \Xspace} p(x) \cdot \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}, $$
  
  or: 
  
  $$ D_{KL}(p \| q) = \E_p \left[\log \frac{p(X)}{q(X)}\right] = \int_{x \in \Xspace} p(x) \cdot \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}. $$

In the above definition, we use the convention that $0 \log (0/0) = 0$ and the
convention (based on continuity arguments) that $0 \log (0/q) = 0$ and $p \log(p/0) = \infty$. 
Thus, if there is any symbol $x \in \Xspace$ such that $p(x) > 0$ and $q(x) = 0$,
then $D_{KL}(p \| q) = \infty.$
  
\framebreak

$$ D_{KL}(p \| q) = \E_p \left[\log \frac{p(X)}{q(X)}\right] $$

\begin{itemize}
  \item  What is the intuition behind this formula?  
  \item  We will soon see that KL has quite some value in measuring \enquote{differences} but is not a true distance. 
  \item  We already see that the formula is not symmetric and it often makes sense to think of $p$ as the first or original form of the data,
    and $q$ as something that we want to measure the quality of with reference to $p$.
  \end{itemize}

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe} {Information Inequality}

$ D_{KL}(p \| q) \geq 0$ holds always true for any pair of distributions, and holds with equality if and only if $p=q$. 

\lz  

We use Jensen's inequality. Let $A$ be the support of $p$:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned} 
-D_{KL}(p \| q) &= -\sum_{x \in A} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \\
                &=  \sum_{x \in A} p(x) \log \frac{q(x)}{p(x)} \\
                &\leq \log \sum_{x \in A} p(x) \frac{q(x)}{p(x)} \\
                &\leq \log \sum_{x \in \Xspace} q(x) = log(1) = 0 
    \end{aligned} 
  \end{equation*}
As $\log$ is strictly concave, Jensen also tells us that equality can only happen if $q(x)/p(x)$ is constant everywhere. That implies $p=q$.
\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe} {KL as Log-Difference}
Suppose that data is being generated from an unknown distribution $p(x)$. 
Suppose we modeled $p(x)$ using an approximating distribution $q(x)$. 

\lz

First, we could simply see KL as the expected log-difference between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$:

  $$ D_{KL}(p \| q) = \E_p(\log(p(x)) - \log(q(x)).$$

This is why we integrate out with respect to the data distribution $p$.
A \enquote{good} approximation $q(x)$ should minimize the difference to $p(x)$.

\framebreak

In machine learning, KL divergence is commonly used to quantify how different one distribution is from another.\\
\lz
\textbf{Example}:
Let $q(x)$ be a binomial distribution with $N = 2$ and $p = 0.3$ and let $p(x)$ be a discrete uniform distribution. Both distributions have the same support $\Xspace = \{0, 1, 2\}$.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\framebreak

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
 D_{KL}(p \| q) &= \sum_{x \in \Xspace} p(x) \ln \left( \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \right)
 \\ &= 0.333 \ln \left( \frac{0.333}{0.49} \right) + 0.333 \ln \left( \frac{0.333}{0.42} \right) + 0.333 \ln \left( \frac{0.333}{0.09} \right) \\ &= 0.23099 \text{    (nats)}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
 D_{KL}(q \| p) &= \sum_{x \in \Xspace} q(x) \ln \left( \frac{q(x)}{p(x)} \right)
 \\ &= 0.49 \ln \left( \frac{0.49}{0.333} \right) + 0.42 \ln \left( \frac{0.42}{0.333} \right) + 0.09 \ln \left( \frac{0.09}{0.333} \right) \\ &= 0.16801 \text{    (nats)}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

Again, note that $D_{KL}(p \| q) \neq D_{KL}(q \| p)$.

\begin{vbframe} {KL in Fitting}

Because KL quantifies the difference between distributions, it can be used as a loss function to find a good fit for the observed data.

\end{vbframe}

\begin{vbframe}{KL as likelihood ratio}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let us assume we have some data and want to figure out whether $p(x)$ or $q(x)$ matches it better.
\item How do we usually do that in stats? Likelihood ratio! 
\end{itemize}

$$ LR = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} $$
  
In the above, if for $x$ we have $LR>1$, then $p$ seems better, for $LR < 1$ $q$ seems better.

\framebreak

Or we can compute LR for a complete set of data (as always, logs make our life easier):
$$ LR = \prod_i \frac{p(\xi)}{q(\xi)} \qquad LLR = \sum_i \log \frac{p(\xi)}{q(\xi)} $$
Now let us assume that our data already come from $p$. It does not really make sense anymore to ask 
whether $p$ or $q$ fit the data better.

But maybe we want to pose the question "How different is $q$ from $p$?" by formulating it as:
"If we sample many data from $p$, how easily can we see that $p$ is better than $q$ through LR, on average?"
$$ \E_p \left[\log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right] $$
That expected LR is really KL!

\framebreak 

In summary we could say for KL:
\begin{itemize}
\item It measures how much "evidence" each sample provides on average to distinguish $p$ from $q$, 
  if you sample from $p$.
\item If $p$ and $q$ are very similar, most samples will not help much, and vice versa for very different distributions.
\item In practice, we often want to make the approximation $q$ as indistinguishable from the real $p$ (our data) as possible. We already did that when we fitted (in our log-difference perspective).
\end{itemize}

%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item For discrete probability distributions 
%    %$p(x)$ and $q(x)$, 
%    the KL divergence %$D_{KL}(p \| q)$ from $p$ to $q$ 
%    is:
%    $$D_{KL}(p \| q) :=  \sum_{x \in \Xspace} p(x) \cdot \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$$
%    \item For probability densities: 
%    %$p(x)$ and $q(x)$, 
%    %the KL divergence 
%    %$D_{KL}(p \| q)$ from $p$ to $q$ is :
%  $$D_{KL}(p \| q) :=  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \cdot \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx $$
%  \item $D_{KL}(p \| q)$ is only defined if, for all $x$, $q(x) = 0$ implies $p(x) = 0$.
  
%  \item $D_{KL}(p \| q) \geq 0$ and $D_{KL}(p \| q) = 0$ only if $p(x) = q(x)$ almost everywhere.
%  %\framebreak
%  \item KL divergence is a measure of the difference between distributions/densities that is in general not symmetric and not a true distance metric.
%  % \item In general: $D_{KL}(p \| q) \neq D_{KL}(q \| p)$ (no symmetry). Therefore, it is not a true \enquote{distance metric}.
%  % \item In machine learning, minimizing the KL divergence between the data distribution and the model distribution is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.
%  % \item Relationship to cross-entropy;
%  %   \begin{align*}
%  %        D_{KL}(p||q) &= H_q(p) - H(p)  \\
%  %        D_{KL}(q||p) &= H_p(q) - H(q)
%  %     \end{align*}
