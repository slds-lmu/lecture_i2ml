\begin{vbframe}{Naive Bayes classifier}

Generative multiclass technique. Remember: We use Bayes' theorem and only need $\pdfxyk$ to compute the posterior as:
$$\pikx \approx \postk = \frac{\P(\xv | y = k) \P(y = k)}{\P(\xv)} = \frac{\pdfxyk \pik}{\sumjg \pdfxyk[j] \pi_j} $$


NB is based on a simple \textbf{conditional independence assumption}: \\
the features are conditionally independent given class $y$.
$$
\pdfxyk = p((x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)|y = k)=\prodjp p(x_j|y = k).
$$
So we only need to specify and estimate the distributions $p(x_j|y = k)$, which is considerably simpler as these are univariate.

\end{vbframe}


\begin{vbframe}{Numerical Features}

Use univariate Gaussians for $p(x_j | y=k)$, and estimate $(\mu_{kj}, \sigma^2_{kj})$. Because of $\pdfxyk = \prodjp p(x_j|y = k)$, joint conditional density is Gaussian with diagonal, non-isotropic covariances, and different across classes, so \textbf{QDA with diagonal covariances}.

Note: In the above plot the data violates the NB assumption. 

\end{vbframe}
\begin{frame}{NB: Categorical Features}

We use a categorical distribution for $p(x_j | y = k)$ and estimate the probabilities $p_{kjm}$ that, in class $k$, our $j$-th feature has value $m$, $x_j = m$, simply by counting  frequencies.

$$
p(x_j | y = k) = \prod_m p_{kjm}^{[x_j = m]}
$$

Because of the simple conditional independence structure, it is also very easy to deal with mixed numerical / categorical feature spaces.

\begin{vbframe}{Laplace Smoothing}
\begin{small}
If a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, e.g.:\\
$p_{\text{no, class, 1st}}^{[x_{class} = \text{1st}]} = 0$ (everyone from 1st class survived in the previous table)

\lz


This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied!

$$
\pi_{no} (\text{class = 1st, sex = male}) = \frac{\hat{p}(x_{class} | y = no) \cdot \hat{p}(x_{sex} | y = no)\cdot \pikh[no]}{\sumjg \hat{p}(\text{class = 1st, sex = male} | y = j)\pih_j} = 0
$$

%$\Rightarrow$ A simple numerical correction is to set these zero probabilities to a small value to regularize against this case.

\begin{vbframe}{Laplace Smoothing}

A simple numerical correction is to set these zero probabilities to a small value to regularize against this case.

\lz
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Add constant $\alpha > 0$ (e.g., $\alpha = 1$).
\item For a categorical feature $x_j$ with $M_j$ possible values:
  $$
  p_{kjm}^{[x_j = m]} = \frac{n_{kjm} + \alpha}{n_{k} + \alpha M_j} \quad \left(\text{instead of }  p_{kjm}^{[x_j = m]} = \frac{n_{kjm}}{n_{k}} \right)
  $$
  where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $n_{kjm}$: count of $x_j = m$ in class $k$,
    \item $n_{k}$: total counts in class $k$,
    \item $M_j$: number of possible distinct values of $x_j$.
  \end{itemize}
%\item Ensures all probs are non-zero, avoiding the product to be zero.
\end{itemize}

\lz

This ensures that our posterior probabilities are non-zero due to such effects, preserving the influence of all features in the model.

% \begin{vbframe}{Laplace Smoothing: Example}

% With Laplace smoothing ($\alpha = 1$), we adjust:
% $$
% p_{\text{no, class, 1st}}^{[x_{class} = \text{1st}]} = \frac{n_{\text{no, class, 1st}} + 1}{n_{\text{class, 1st}} + 1 \cdot M_{class}},
% $$
% where $M_{class} = 3$ (= number of distinct values for $x_{class}$: 1st, 2nd, 3rd).

% \lz


% Even if $n_{\text{no, class, 1st}} = 0$ (everyone from 1st class survived), we get $p_{\text{no, class, 1st}} > 0$.
% % $$
% % \P(\text{no} | \text{class = 1st, sex = male}) = \frac{p_{\text{no, class, 1st}} \cdot p_{\text{no, sex, male}} \cdot \pikh[no]}{\sumjg p(\text{class = 1st, sex = male} | y = j)\pih_j} > 0.

% This ensures that the posterior probability is non-zero, preserving the influence of all features in the model.

\begin{vbframe}{Naive Bayes: application as spam filter}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the late 90s, NB became popular for e-mail spam detection 
  \item Word counts were used as features to detect spam mails
  \item Independence assumption implies: occurrence of two words in mail is not correlated, this is often wrong; \\
  "viagra" more likely to occur in context with "buy"...
  \item In practice: often still good performance
\end{itemize}
