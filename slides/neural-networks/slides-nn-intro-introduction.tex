\begin{framei}{What is Deep Learning}
\item Deep learning is a subfield of ML based on artificial neural networks.

\begin{frame}{Deep Learning and Neural Networks}
\textbf{Deep learning itself is not \textit{new}:}
\begin{itemizeM}
\item Neural networks have been around since the 70s.
\item \textit{Deep} neural networks, i.e., networks with multiple hidden layers, are not much younger.
\end{itemizeM}
\textbf{Why everybody is talking about deep learning now:}
\begin{itemizeM}
\item Specialized, powerful hardware allows training of huge neural networks to push the state-of-the-art on difficult problems.
\item Large amount of data is available.
\item Special network architectures for image/text data.
\item Better optimization and regularization strategies.
\end{itemizeM}

\begin{frame}{Possible use-cases}
\textbf{Deep learning can be extremely valuable if the data has these properties:}
\begin{itemizeM}
\item It is high dimensional.
\item Each single feature itself is not very informative but only a combination of them might be.
\item There is a large amount of training data.
\end{itemizeM}
\textbf{This implies that for tabular data, deep learning is rarely the correct model choice.}
\begin{itemizeM}
\item Specialized, powerful hardware allows training of huge neural networks to push the state-of-the-art on difficult problems.
\item Without extensive tuning, models like random forests or gradient boosting will outperform deep learning most of the time.
\item One exception is data with categorical features with many levels.
\end{itemizeM}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Possible use-case: Images}
\begin{itemizeM}
\item \textbf{High Dimensional}: A color image with $255 \times 255$ (3 Colors) pixels already has $195075$ features.
\item \textbf{Informative}: A single pixel is not meaningful in itself.
\item \textbf{Training Data}: Depending on applications huge amounts of data are available.
\end{itemizeM}

\textbf{Image classification} tries to predict a single label for each image.
\footnotesize CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset used for image classification. It consists of $60,000$ $32x32$ color images containing one of $10$ object classes, with $6000$ images per class.

\textbf{Object Detection}
\footnotesize Mask R-CNN is a general framework for instance segmentation, that efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance.

\begin{framei} {Possible use-case: Text}
\item \textbf{High Dimensional}: Each word can be a single feature (300000 words in the German language).
\item \textbf{Informative}: A single word does not provide much context.
\item \textbf{Training Data}: Huge amounts of text data available.
