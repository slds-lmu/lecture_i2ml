\begin{vbframe} {Underdetermined problems}

Regularization can also be motivated from a numerical perspective: 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regularization can sometimes be necessary to make certain ill-posed problems well defined. Linear models such as (linear) regression and PCA depend on "inverting" / solving a linear system, which does not always work.
    \item When we solve linear systems like $\Xmat \thetab = \bm{y}$, there are 3 cases:  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \begin{footnotesize}
    \item $\Xmat$ is of square form and has full rank. This is normal linear system solving and irrelevant for us here, now. 
   \item $\Xmat$ has more rows than columns. The system is "overdetermined". We now try to solve
      $\Xmat \thetab \approx \bm{y}$, by minimizing $|| \Xmat \thetab - \bm{y}||$. Ideally, this difference would be zero, but due to the too many rows this is often not possible. This is equivalent to linear regression!
   \item $\Xmat$ has more columns than rows / linear dependence between columns exists. Now there are usually an infinite number of solutions. We have to define a "preference" for them to make the problem well-defined (sounds familiar?). Such problems are called $"$underdetermined$"$.
  \end{footnotesize}
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}

\framebreak
  \begin{itemize}
   \item A very old and well-known approach in underdetermined cases is to still reduce the problem to optimization by minimizing $|| \Xmat \thetab - \bm{y}||$, but adding a small positiv constant to the diagonal of $\Xmat^T \Xmat$.
   \item In optimization / numerical analysis this is known as \textbf{Tikhonov} regularization. 
   \item But as you should be able to see now: This is completely equivalent to Ridge regression!
  \end{itemize}

\framebreak
\begin{footnotesize}
We now study not the normal LM (which we could), but logistic regression applied to a linearly separable dataset for a more subtle example:

\medskip
First, we take a look at logistic regression for an almost linearly separable dataset consisting of the observations $\xv^{(1)}, \dots, \xv^{(8)}$.

Note: WLOG we estimate the
model without intercept, s.t. we can visualize the regression coefficient 
$\bm{\theta}$ in 2D. Also, the symmetry of the data does not influence the generality of our conclusions.
\end{footnotesize}

\framebreak
\begin{footnotesize}
Because of the symmetry of the data, the direction\footnote[frame]{$\bm{\theta}$ is perpendicular to the decision boundary and points to the "1"-space.} of $\bm{\theta}$ is $\tilde\thetab := (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^\top$.

\medskip

To find $\overline{\theta} := ||\bm{\theta}||_2$, we consider the empirical risk $\riske$ along $\tilde\thetab$:
\begin{align*}
\riske &= \sum^8_{i=1} \log \left[1 + \exp \left(-y^{(i)}\thetab^\top \xv^{(i)}\right)\right] \\
&= \underbrace{\sum^6_{i=1} \log \left[1 + \exp \left(- \overline{\theta} \left|\tilde{\thetab}^\top \xv^{(i)}\right|\right)\right]}_{=: \; f_{\text{cor}}(\overline{\theta}) \;\text{(correctly classified)}} +
\underbrace{\sum^8_{i=7}\log \left[1 + \exp \left( \overline{\theta} \left| \tilde{\thetab}^\top \xv^{(i)}\right|\right)\right]}_{=:\; f_{\text{incor}}(\overline{\theta}) \;\text{(incorrectly classified)}}.
\end{align*}
Clearly, $f_{\text{cor}}$ / $f_{\text{incor}}$ are monotonically decreasing/increasing with rising length of $\thetab$:

\begin{vbframe} {Underconstrained problems}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{itemize}
\item By removing the 7th and 8th observation, we get a linearly separable dataset. \\
\item This also means that we lose our "counterweight", i.e., if a parameter vector $\thetab$ is able to classify the samples perfectly, the vector $2\thetab$ also classifies the samples perfectly, with decreased risk.
    \item Therefore, an iterative optimizer such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) will continually increase $\thetab$ and never halt (in theory).
    \item In such cases, regularization can guarantee convergence:
