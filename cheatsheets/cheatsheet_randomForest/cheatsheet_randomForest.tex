                        \item Bagging is short for \textbf{B}ootstrap \textbf{Agg}regation
                        \item It's an \textbf{ensemble method}, i.e., it combines many models into one 
        big \enquote{meta-model}
                        \item The constituent models of an ensemble are called \textbf{base learners}
                        \item All base learners are of the same type. The only difference between the models is the data they are trained on.
                        \end{itemize}
				
						\begin{codebox}
			\textbf{Bagging: }
						\end{codebox}
						Base learners $\blm, m = 1, \dots, M$ are trained on $M$ \textbf{bootstrap} samples of training data $\D$. \textbf{Aggregate} the predictions of the $M$ fitted base learners to get the \textbf{ensemble model} $\fMh$.

						\begin{codebox}
			\textbf{Note: }
						\end{codebox}
						Gains performance by reducing the variance of predictions, but (slightly) increases the bias: it reuses training data many times, so small mistakes can get amplified and Works best if base learners' predictions are only weakly correlated.

  \item Tree baselearners on bootstrap samples of the data

  With the RF it is possible to obtain unbiased estimates of generalization error directly during training, based on the out-of-bag observations for each tree:

  \item Single trees are highly interpretable and Random Forests as ensembles of trees lose this feature
  \item Contributions of the different features to the model are difficult to evaluate
  \item Way out: variable importance measures
  \item Basic idea: by how much would performance of the random forest decrease if a specific feature were removed or rendered useless?

  A measure of similarity ("closeness" or "nearness") of observations derived from random forests

  \end{codebox}
  
  
  \begin{itemize}[$\bullet$]     
  \setlength{\itemindent}{+.3in}
  \item The proximity between two observations $\xi$ and $\xi[j]$ is calculated by measuring the number of times that these two observations are placed in the same terminal node of the same tree of random forest, divided by the number of trees in the forest
  \item The proximity of observations $\xi$ and $\xi[j]$ can be written as $\operatorname{prox}\left(\xi, \xi[j]\right)$
    \item The proximities form an intrinsic similarity measure between pairs of observations
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{codebox}
  \textbf{Usage of random forest proximities: }
  \end{codebox}
  Imputing missing data, locating outliers, identifying mislabeled data, visualizing the forest.

  \begin{myblock}{Synopsis}
  \textbf{Hypothesis Space:}
  Random forest models are (sums of) step functions over rectangular partitions of (subspaces of) $\Xspace$.
  \vspace*{1ex}
  
  \textbf{Risk:}
  Like trees, random forests can use any kind of loss function for regression or classification.
  \vspace*{1ex}
  
  \textbf{Optimization:}
  Exhaustive search over all (randomly selected!) candidate splits in each node of each tree to minimize the empirical risk in the child nodes.
