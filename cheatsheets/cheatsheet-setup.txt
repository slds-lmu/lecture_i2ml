1) we need to clean up the latex "umbrella" code in the cheatsheets,
this is lots of copy paste dreck, we need a general setup file
in lecture_service

2) the cheatsheets dont need all their own subfolders, if we do this cleanly

3)  major problem is: how do we structure things?
creating cheatsheets "per chapter" seems nice and easy. 
but if we do this differently we might get away with less?
also there is a certrain overlap between i2ml and SL


outline


a) CS "notation": we keep that. all other sheets should be 
orthogonal to this

b) outline 
Chapter 1: ML Basics  ---> covered on "notation"

Chapter 2: Supervised Regression                        -> separate sheet, more complex. instructions:
                                                           * orthogonal to "ml basics / notation" 
                                                           * should cover the regression algo of the chapter
                                                           LMs, polyreg
Chapter 03: Supervised Classification                   -> separate sheet, more complex. instructions:
                                                           * orthogonal to "ml basics / notation" 
                                                           * should cover the regression algo of the chapter
                                                           Logreg, LDA, QDA, NB
Chapter 04: Performance Evaluation                      -> separate sheet 
                                                        (before it was "eval+tuning", separate it)
Chapter 05: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)                  -> skip now, add somewhere later
Chapter 06: Classification and Regression Trees (CART)  -> separate sheet, use existing sheet, update it and make it better                
Chapter 07: Random Forests                              -> separate sheet, use existing sheet, update it and make it better                
Chapter 08: Neural Networks                             -> separate sheet 
Chapter 09: Tuning                                      -> joint sheet "tuning and nested resampling"
