    "First and foremost, evaluation on the training data is almost never a good idea. Under certain conditions the training error does tell us something about generalization ability, but for flexible learners and/or small training data it is deceptive due to optimistic bias. In this particular situation, we have few training observations and quite some points that look a little extreme. A low training error might be achieved by a learner that fits every quirk in the training data but generalizes poorly to unseen points with only slightly different distribution. Evaluation on separate test data is therefore non-negotiable."
