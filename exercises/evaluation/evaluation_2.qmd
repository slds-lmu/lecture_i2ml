## Exercise 1: Overfitting & underfitting

::: {.callout-note title="Learning goals" icon=false}
TBD
:::

Assume a polynomial regression model with a continuous target variable $y$ and a continuous, $p$-dimensional feature vector $\xv$ and polynomials of degree $d$, i.e., 

$$
\fxi = \sum_{j=1}^p \sum_{k=0}^d \theta_{j,k} (\xi_j)^k,
$$

and $\yi = \fxi + \epsi$ where the $\epsi$ are iid with $\var(\epsi)=\sigma^2 \ \forall i\in \{1, \dots, n\}$. 

***
For each of the following situations, indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible polynomial learner (high $d$) to be better or worse than an inflexible one (low $d$). Justify your answer.

<details> 
<summary>**NB**</summary>
We can only state tendencies here -- performance strongly depends on the specific data situation.
</details> 

***
i. The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of features $p$ is small.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
We expect the flexible learner to perform better because it covers a large number of hypotheses and we have enough data to tell them apart, so there is little risk of overfitting, while the inflexible learner might underfit.
</details> 
:::

***
ii. The number of features $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
With a flexible learner we might quickly run into overfitting here. The data situation, which we frequently encounter in biostatistics (e.g., genomics data), creates a high-dimensional and sparsely populated input space with a training distribution that is easy to overfit. Therefore, a low-degree polynomial should fare better (but note that it is not immune to overfitting either in this challenging setting). Some sort of feature selection could be advisable first.
</details> 
:::

***
iii. The true relationship between the features and the response is highly non-linear.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
The inflexible learner will likely underfit here, so the flexible variant can be expected to perform better.
</details> 
:::

***
iv. The variance of the error terms, $\sigma^2$, is extremely high.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
The flexible learner might interpolate between the noisy training samples, creating a wiggly curve that generalizes poorly, so we expect better performance from a less complex learner.
</details> 
:::

***
Are overfitting and underfitting properties of a learner or of a fixed model? Explain your answer.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
Overfitting and underfitting are always connected to a particular fixed *model*, even though attributes of the underlying hypothesis space typically influence the tendency toward one or the other behavior, as we have seen in the previous question. In order to understand this, think of a classification problem with linearly separable data. Applying a QDA learner, which is able to learn more complex decision boundaries, poses a risk of overfitting with the chosen model, but the degree of overfitting depends on the model itself. In theory, the QDA learner is free to set equal covariances for the Gaussian class densities, amounting to LDA and *not* overfitting the data. Under- and overfitting are therefore properties of a specific model and not of an entire learner.

A common strategy is to choose a rather flexible model class and encourage simplicity in the actual model by *regularization* (e.g., take a higher-degree polynomial but drive as many coefficients a possible toward zero, which you might know as LASSO regression).
</details> 
:::

***
Should we aim to completely avoid both overfitting and underfitting?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
That will be hardly possible. Recall how we defined the two variants of data fit:

$$
UF(\fh, L) = GE(\fh, L) - GE(f^\ast, L)
$$

$$
OF(\fh, L) = GE(\fh, L) - \riske(\fh, L)
$$

In order to avoid underfitting completely we would need to always find the universally loss-optimal model across arbitrary hypothesis spaces (the so-called *Bayes-optimal* model), which is obviously not something we can hope to achieve in general. Zero overfitting would mean to exactly balance theoretical generalization error and empirical risk, but the way empirical risk minimization is designed, our model will likely fare a bit worse on unseen test data.

In practice we will always experience these phenomena to some degree and finding a model that trades them off well is the holy grail in machine learning.

## Exercise 2: Resampling strategies

::: {.callout-note title="Learning goals" icon=false}
TBD
:::

***
a. Why would we apply resampling rather than a single holdout split?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
The two main advantages of resampling are:
  
- We are able to use larger training sets (at the expense of test set size) because the high variance this incurs for the resulting estimator is smoothed out by averaging across repetitions.

- Repeated sampling reduces the risk of getting lucky (or not so lucky) with a particular data split, which is especially relevant with few observations.

c. In order to evaluate your learner, compare test MCE using

> i) three times ten-fold cross validation (3x10-CV)
> ii) 10x3-CV
> iii) 3x10-CV with stratification for the feature \texttt{foreign\_worker} to ensure equal representation in all folds

d. Discuss and compare your findings from c) and compare them to the training error from b).

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
Generalization error estimates are pretty stable across the different resampling strategies because we have a fairly large number (1000) of observations. Still, the pessimistic bias of small training sets is visible: 10x3-CV, using roughly 67% of data for training in each split, estimates a higher generalization error than 3x10-CV with roughly 90% training data. Stratification by *foreign_worker* does not seem to have much effect on the estimate. However, we see a glaring difference when we use a single 90%-10% split, where the estimated GE is roughly 7 percentage points lower than with 3x10-CV, meaning we got a low error just because of a lucky split.

Comparing the results (except for the unreliable one produced by a single split) with the training error from b) indicates no serious overfitting.

e. Would you consider LOO-CV to be a good alternative?

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
$LOO$ is not a very good idea here -- with 1000 observations this would take a very long time. Also, $LOO$ has high variance by nature. Repeated CV with a sufficient number of folds should give us a pretty good idea about the expected GE of our learner.
