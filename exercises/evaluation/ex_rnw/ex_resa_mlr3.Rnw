\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Why would we apply resampling rather than a single holdout split?
  \item Classify the \texttt{german\_credit} data into 
  solvent and insolvent debtors using
  logistic regression. Compute the training error w.r.t. MCE.\\
    (\texttt{Python} Hint: Read the already preprocessed file \texttt{german\_credit\_for\_py.csv}.)  
  \item In order to evaluate your learner, compare test MCE using
  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item three times ten-fold cross validation (3x10-CV)
    \item 10x3-CV
    \item 3x10-CV with stratification for the feature \texttt{foreign\_worker} 
    to ensure equal representation in all folds
    \item a single holdout split with 90\% training data
  \end{enumerate}
  (\texttt{R} Hint: you will need \texttt{rsmp}, \texttt{resample} and \texttt{aggregate}.)\\
  (\texttt{Python} Hint: you will need \texttt{RepeatedKFold}, \texttt{RepeatedStratifiedKFold} and \texttt{train\_test\_split}.)  
  \item Discuss and compare your findings from c) and compare them to the 
  training error from b).
  \item Would you consider LOO-CV to be a good alternative?
\end{enumerate}
