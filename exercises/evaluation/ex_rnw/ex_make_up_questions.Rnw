For this week's inverted classroom, we have arranged a small \textbf{I2ML quiz tournament} for you.
Within your group, you get to answer a set of quiz questions covering the entire course content up to now, and the highest-performing group will be awarded a small prize.
However, the quiz questions shall not be provided by us, but by your fellow students!
Therefore, each group is tasked to come up with a multiple-choice question for the quiz:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Choose the subject for your question on the Google Doc.
  There has to be at least one group per subject, and there can be no more than two groups per subject.
  The link can be found in this week's etherpad.
    \item Think of a suitable quiz question for your subject.
    The question must be multiple-choice with 2 or 3 answer options, with exactly one of them being correct.
    Be as short and precise as possible.
    Make sure the \textbf{question is fair} to your fellow students.
    \item Submit your question to the e-mail address provided in the etherpad in the following format:
\end{enumerate}
