In this session, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Construct and interpret ROC curves.
  \item Calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
  \item Analyze the impact of data imbalance and decision thresholds on model performance.
  \item Collaborate with peers to compare results and discuss findings.
\end{itemize}


Below a table that consist of true labels (\texttt{y}) and predicted probabilities of four different classifiers ($\hat\pi_1, \hat\pi_2, \hat\pi_3, \hat\pi_4$) generated from hypothetical models.

<<echo=FALSE, results='asis'>>=
# Define the actual labels and predicted probabilities
y <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)

# Predicted probabilities for different models
pi_1 <- c(0.99, 0.6, 0.95, 0.7, 0.8, 0.1, 0.3)
pi_2 <- c(0.1, 0.05, 0.07, 0.15, 0.01, 0.08, 0.02)
pi_3 <- c(0.01, 0.4, 0.05, 0.3, 0.2, 0.9, 0.7)
pi_4 <- c(0.7, 0.9, 0.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.1, 0.3)

# Specify column names with LaTeX math mode
col_names <- c("$y$", "$\\hat\\pi_1$", "$\\hat\\pi_2$", "$\\hat\\pi_3$", "$\\hat\\pi_4$")

# Output datasets as LaTeX tables
kable(
  data.frame(
    y = y,
    pi_1,
    pi_2,
    pi_3,
    pi_4
  ), 
  format = "latex",
  escape = FALSE,
  col.names = col_names

\textbf{Tasks}

\begin{itemize} 
\item Step 1: 
Watch as the instructor demonstrates how to plot the ROC curve using $\hat{\pi}_1$ and explains the steps.

\item Step 2: Form groups of 4-6 people and
\begin{itemize} 
\item Complete the ROC curve for $\hat{\pi}_1$. 
\item Plot the ROC curves for $\hat{\pi}_2$, $\hat{\pi}_3$, and $\hat{\pi}_4$.
\item Manually calculate the AUC for each classifier and compare the results. 
\item Compute the prevalence and the average of the predicted probability of each classifier across all 7 observations.
\end{itemize}

\item Step 3: Within your group, discuss:
\begin{itemize} 
\item How the differences in predictions affect the ROC curves and AUC values. 
\item The differences between average predicted probability and the prevalence. 
\item Group A students: Assume you want to obtain a high partial AUC (pAUC) for low FPR values (e.g., using the constraint: FPR $< 0.2$). Compare the pAUC of the four classifiers.
\item Key takeaways from comparing the four classifiers. 
\end{itemize}

\item Step 4: Formulate 1-2 challenging TRUE-FALSE questions about ROC curves and post them into the Etherpad in Moodle. Nominate a group leader to present one question to the class and explain its relevance. 
\end{itemize}
