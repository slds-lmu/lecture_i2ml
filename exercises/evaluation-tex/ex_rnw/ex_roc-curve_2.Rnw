In this session, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Construct and interpret ROC curves.
  \item Calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
  \item Analyze the impact of data imbalance and decision thresholds on model performance.
  \item Collaborate with peers to compare results and discuss findings.
\end{itemize}


Below a table that consist of true labels (\texttt{y}) and predicted probabilities of four different classifiers ($\hat\pi_1, \hat\pi_2, \hat\pi_3, \hat\pi_4$) generated from hypothetical models.

<<echo=FALSE, results='asis'>>=
# Define the actual labels and predicted probabilities
y <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)

# Predicted probabilities for different models
pi_1 <- c(0.99, 0.6, 0.95, 0.7, 0.8, 0.1, 0.3)
pi_2 <- c(0.1, 0.05, 0.07, 0.15, 0.01, 0.08, 0.02)
pi_3 <- c(0.01, 0.4, 0.05, 0.3, 0.2, 0.9, 0.7)
pi_4 <- c(0.7, 0.9, 0.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.1, 0.3)

# Specify column names with LaTeX math mode
col_names <- c("$y$", "$\\hat\\pi_1$", "$\\hat\\pi_2$", "$\\hat\\pi_3$", "$\\hat\\pi_4$")

# Output datasets as LaTeX tables
kable(
  data.frame(
    y = y,
    pi_1,
    pi_2,
    pi_3,
    pi_4
  ), 
  format = "latex",
  escape = FALSE,
  col.names = col_names

\textbf{Tasks}

\begin{itemize} 
\item Step 1: 
Watch as the instructor demonstrates how to plot the ROC curve using $\hat{\pi}_1$ and explains the steps.

\item Step 2: Form groups of 4-6 people and
\begin{itemize} 
\item Complete the ROC curve for $\hat{\pi}_1$. 
\item Plot the ROC curves for $\hat{\pi}_2$, $\hat{\pi}_3$, and $\hat{\pi}_4$.
\item Manually calculate the AUC for each classifier and the average predicted probability for each classifier across all 7 observations and compare the results. 
\end{itemize}

\item Step 3: Within your group, discuss:
\begin{itemize} 
\item How the differences in predictions affect the ROC curves and AUC values. 
\item What can you say about the average predicted probability for each classifier? Compare this with the prevalence.
\item For group A students: Assume you want to obtain a high partial AUC for low FPR values (e.g., FPR $< 0.2$). What can you say about the partial AUC of the four classifiers?
\item Key takeaways from comparing the four classifiers. 
\end{itemize}

\item Step 4: Formulate 1-2 challenging TRUE-FALSE questions about ROC curves. Nominate a group leader to present one question to the class and explain its relevance. 
\end{itemize}
