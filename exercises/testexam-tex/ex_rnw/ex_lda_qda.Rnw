Derive the LDA decision boundary for a binary problem in
two dimensions. For this, employ the alternative description of the LDA
decision rule we (implicitly) used to demonstrate LDAâ€™s linearity:
\[
  \delta_k(\xv) = \log \pik  - \frac{1}{2} \muk^\top \Sigma^{-1} \muk
  + \xv^\top \Sigma^{-1} \muk, ~~ k \in \{1, 2\}.
\]
Explicitly state the equation for the boundary between the two classes.
