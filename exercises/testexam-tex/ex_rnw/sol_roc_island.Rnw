\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item The objective of identifying as many virus-positive travelers as possible is best served with the Cyano test. Since the $TPR$ has to be 1.00, Cyano allows for the threshold to be chosen to achieve a lower $FPR$ of roughly 0.625, whereas Acotest only achieves an $FPR$ of about 0.78 for the same $TPR$.
  \item Acotest is best suited for this demand. Since the $FPR$ has to be 0.00, it allows for the threshold to be chosen to achieve a higher $TPR$ than Cyano. In this case, a maximum of roughly 50 percent of all virus-positive travelers can be expected to be filtered out by the testing regime.
